## Description

The joint developed Web application **Triolingo** was created to provide language learners with quick and accessible language questions to interact with. The project was built to quiz users so that they can gauge their language proficiency. Concepts learned in the application include deploying to the PaaS (Platform as a service) service Heroku, as well as setting up different routes for getting and adding data. Another important concept learned was the protection of sensitive information using environment variables. Authentication using bcrypt was learned, as well as mysql for the database. And we can't forget learning handlebars to implement templating that enabled us to create reusable webpage templates.
